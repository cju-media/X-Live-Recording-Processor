// Minimal native launcher so X-Live Processor behaves like a normal Mac app in the Dock.
//
// The actual server (xlive-processor, a bare `pkg`-built Node executable) has no AppKit/Cocoa
// involvement at all, so on its own it can't participate in the standard macOS app lifecycle:
// the Dock only stops bouncing an icon once the app signals "I'm a real GUI app and I'm ready"
// via AppKit, which a plain command-line binary never does - as CFBundleExecutable directly, its
// Dock icon bounces forever and never settles. Making it CFBundleExecutable instead, this tiny
// wrapper IS a real (albeit windowless) AppKit app: it settles in the Dock normally, and Cmd+Q /
// the Dock's Quit menu item deliver a proper Apple Event to applicationShouldTerminate(_:)
// instead of the OS's fallback of just sending SIGTERM to a non-cooperating process.
//
// It has no window of its own - the actual GUI is the browser tab server.js opens - it only
// exists to give the process tree a real AppKit presence and a clean shutdown path.
